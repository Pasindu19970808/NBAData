- Use of Scikit learn(Linear Regressor, Support Vector Regressor, Random Forest Regressor)
- Use of Scikit learn pipelines and custom classes implementing Abstract Base Classes (fit and fit_transform)
- Web scraping for data using urllib, BeautifulSoup
- Use of list comprehension to improve runtime
- Use of sample weights on training algorithms
